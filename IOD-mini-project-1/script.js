        history: [
            "Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher who lived from 55 to 135 AD. He was born a slave in Phrygia, but later gained his freedom and became a prominent teacher of Stoicism. His teachings emphasized the importance of personal responsibility, self-discipline, and the power of the mind to shape one's experience of life. Epictetus believed that true happiness comes from within and that we should focus on what we can control rather than external circumstances.",
