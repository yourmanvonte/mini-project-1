            "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus\" target=\"blank\">Epictetus</a> was a Greek Stoic philosopher who lived from 55 to 135 AD. He was born a slave in Phrygia, but later gained his freedom and became a prominent teacher of Stoicism. His teachings emphasized the importance of personal responsibility, self-discipline, and the power of the mind to shape one's experience of life. Epictetus believed that true happiness comes from within and that we should focus on what we can control rather than external circumstances."

Renowned for his writings on ethics, reason, and self-discipline, Seneca became a key figure in shaping Roman Stoicism through works like Letters to Lucilius and On the Shortness of Life. Though entangled in imperial politics and eventually forced to commit suicide, his legacy endures through his philosophical insights on resilience, virtue, and the pursuit of a meaningful lifeâ€”principles that continue to influence thinkers, writers, and modern Stoic practice today."
